So as a semi professional chess player,I feel the necessity of having an opening repertoire.
Say you have 100 lines of repertoire where they are actually sub variations from 10 differnt opening.
So it would be so much better if all the variations were merged into 10 separate chapters with keeping all the comment.
I have used the same fen logic to start with,then I have selected those files where name of the whites are same.
I have also made a basic tinkter gui so that people wont have to run it from the terminal.My goal is to add this feature 
inside a open source chess app.
